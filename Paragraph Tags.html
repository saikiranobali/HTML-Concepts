<p>"I draw inspiration from my past successes and failures.And I really dont want to mention them as failures I think they are the learnings from my point of view.And I just want to improve my areas where Iam weak at.I need to focus on those areas. I thought that as a human being everyone needs to improve their  weaker areas on daily basis to compete with this world, you know that every day is a new challenge and you need to accept every challenge in your life whether it may be toughest or eaisest, the term toughest makes that challenge as toughest but you need to stay positive accept with courage.To be honest you need to work hard for that challenge just focus on your game. Every setback is a path which leads to your strong comeback."</p>
